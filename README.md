Employee Leave Management System (ELMS)

A full-stack web application to manage employee leave requests with real-time approval/rejection, geolocation tracking, and analytics.

Project Overview

    ELMS is designed to streamline leave management for organizations:

    Employees can apply for leaves while their location and IP are automatically logged.

    Administrators and HR can approve/reject requests, monitor leave trends, and generate audit-ready reports.

    Focused on efficiency, transparency, and actionable insights.

Key Highlights

    Location Logging

    Automatically captures latitude, longitude, and IP for each leave application.

    Helps verify application authenticity and monitor remote work locations.

    Email Notifications

    Sends automatic emails for leave approval or rejection.

    Keeps employees and managers informed in real-time.

    Export

    Leave history can be exported to PDF or Excel for auditing and record-keeping.

    Analytics & Visualization

    Interactive charts show leave trends, statistics, and team leave utilization.

    Helps HR and management make data-driven decisions.
